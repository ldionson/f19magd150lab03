## Bubble Dots Program
**The dots swirl and enlarge!** This bubble program was created to exercise the color changing, text, and mouse position functions.

Watch the color of the bubbles change to increments within the grey scale, as they **rotate** and **enlarge** depending on where your mouse is positioned.

When you **click**, the program resets to the original state.
